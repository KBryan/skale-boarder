This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

This app is designed to demonstrate the front-end tooling of the skaleboarder ecosystem.

Most of the magic happens in the [_app.tsx](./src/pages/_app.tsx) page.

You'll notice that [addresses.json](./src/addresses.json) is a symlink to the [demo-contracts](../demo-contracts) package in this mono repo.
